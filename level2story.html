                She realized that she needed a torch to light her way. Just then, she saw a man walking towards her.
                She approached him and asked if he had a torch she could borrow. The man replied, "I don't have a torch,
                but I can give you a clue to help you find one."The girl was curious and asked what the clue was.
                The man said, "Look for the tallest tree in the forest. At the base of the tree, you'll find 
                what you seek."The girl thanked the man and continued on her journey,but there are many tallest
                trees surrounded by her.So,it became difficult to find.

                    Now you need to find the torch among all tallest trees.
